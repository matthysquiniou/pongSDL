# Pong in C++ with SDL

This project is one of my first programs written in **C++**.  
The main goal was to discover the **SDL** library and use it to create a simple **Pong** game.

## Project Goal
- Learn how to use SDL (rendering, keyboard input handling, game loop)
- Understand the basics of a 2D game
- Work with movement and collision logic

## Controls

| Player | Key | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Left paddle | **Z** | Move up |
| Left paddle | **S** | Move down |
| Right paddle | **Up arrow** | Move up |
| Right paddle | **Down arrow** | Move down |

## Technologies Used
- C++
- SDL

## Note
This project is intentionally simple and mainly serves as a learning exercise.
